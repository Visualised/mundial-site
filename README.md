Simple website with an integrated API about Fifa World Cup 2022 Qatar.

I've created a simple website with a REST API based on Django web framework. Application is based on MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern and also incorporates Django-Rest-Framework in addition to Django ORM, Django Migration Tool and usage of Templates. The API part exposes /player, /country, /match endpoints which support GET, PATCH, POST, DELETE http methods to process CRUD requests, it operates on data stored in SQL database of choice with database model created in Django ORM. Users can also create accounts and log into them. The project is still in development.

I'm focused on the backend side of the project - the frontend part is copied from internet and slightly modified to suit my application.
